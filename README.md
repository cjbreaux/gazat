* Custom logo and favicon
* Dynamic routing between city pages
* Populate blog-tiles with city specific data
* Deployment to Firebase


### Planned Features
* Remote hosting of city data on Firebase

* Page does not properly update unless two different cities are selected on the default page

### Technologies and Resources

* Angular
* Angular CLI
* HTML  
* SCSS
